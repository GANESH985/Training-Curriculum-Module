1. Coding Standards

Follow these coding standards to maintain a consistent and readable codebase:

    JavaScript:
        Adhere to the Airbnb JavaScript Style Guide.
        Use meaningful variable and function names.
        Keep functions small and focused.

    Node.js:
        Follow best practices for asynchronous programming.
        Utilize error-first callback pattern.
        Make use of ES6 features when appropriate.

2. Documentation

Documentation is as important as code. Ensure that your code is well-documented:

    Code Comments:
        Add comments for complex or non-trivial sections of code.
        Clearly document the purpose of functions and methods.

    README:
        Update the project README with instructions for installation, usage, and contribution.
        Include a concise project overview.

3. Development Workflow

    Branching:
        Create a new branch for each feature or bug fix.
        Branch names should be descriptive (e.g., feature/user-authentication).

    Pull Requests:
        Open pull requests early to encourage collaboration and discussion.
        Reference the relevant issue in your pull request.

4. Testing

    Unit Tests:
        Write unit tests for new features.
        Ensure existing tests are maintained and updated.

    Integration Tests:
        Test the integration of components and modules.

5. Version Control

    Commits:
        Write clear and concise commit messages.
        Follow the Conventional Commits standard.

    Git Flow:
        Follow the Git Flow branching model.

6. Deployment

    Continuous Integration:
        Set up CI/CD pipelines for automated testing and deployment.
        Deploy to staging environments before production.

    Environment Configuration:
        Use environment variables for configuration.
        Store sensitive information securely.

7. Communication

    Team Meetings:
        Participate in regular team meetings.
        Discuss progress, challenges, and plans.

    Discord/Communication Channel:
        Use Discord or another communication channel for quick updates and discussions.
